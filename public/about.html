<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Prasmit, a second-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science.</p><p>I’m passionate about technology and driven by a love for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.
  Currently, I’m honing my skills in data structures and web development. Through various projects and coursework, I’ve gained practical experience in C,C++,Python,etc, and I’m excited about applying these skills to real-world challenges.</p>
  Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing chess and swimming. Chess sharpens my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities, while swimming helps me stay active and focused. These hobbies keep me balanced and motivated, both in and out of the classroom.</p>
  <p>I’m always eager to connect with fellow students, professionals, and anyone interested in technology. If you’re up for discussing tech trends, collaborating on a project, or just sharing insights, feel free to reach out!</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
